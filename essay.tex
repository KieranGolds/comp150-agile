\section{Introduction To be completed}

Write your introduction here. A brief introduction is recommended, which should outline key details of the chosen topic and the reviewed papers, motivate the work, and provide a roadmap of key points to the reader. The motivation is quite important here, as essays should have a contribution (i.e., what is the point of the essay, and what does the reader take away from the essay) and the link between the motivation (in the introduction) and the contribution (in the conclusion) should be made clear.

\section{Quality assurance}

paper QA in agile:
-QA suggests early and often, maybe more important at the start 
-Continuous integration prevents this, build quality debt
-Customer and developemtn factors control software quality
-presented to customer early and often
-cycle time is almost constant to ensure software quality is always good

Understanding and Controlling Software Costs:
-avoiding rework
-integrated support project environments 
-rapid prototyping through integration
-

Software development life cycle AGILE vs traditional approaches
-again early customer involvement 
-delivers results quickly and more cost efffectivley 
-has diagrams comparison on costs and productivity 
-high customer involvement 

Software quality and agile methods
-

Effects of process maturity on quality, cycle time, and effort in software product development
-diagram on conceptual model which links to the other two from pic 1 and 3, yet again on the links between software quality and factors I need to discuss
-compares lower and higher cylce time in comparison to product quality which links to question highly, v important for discussion below
-includes hypothesis and testing for above discussion
-very inportant graphs in the conclusion associating product quality against development effort


 

subject to cover and compare:
-integration and when to 
-customer impact- paper 1 has diagram that helps
-why agile over traditional for productivity and cost benefits- paper 1 + 3
lots of diagrams in the paper which agreee and disagree with each, investigation needed

maybe change question to do with software quality

\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. The conclusion should do more than summarise the essay, making clear the contribution of the work and highlighting key points, limitations, and outstanding questions. It should not introduce any new content or information.
